## Running Tests

As you misunderstood in the previous kata, my use of Karma, I put just the JS file (src and test)

For your information: Karma or Jasmine, ... or any other Javascript test tool, allows you to run the test cases from an interface and display the test result.

It does not make sense if the application has a UI or not...

In brief, if you want to run and see the test results, you can use Jasmine "Javascript application test tool"
